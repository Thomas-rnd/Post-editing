The primary objective of this notebook is to fine-tune a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) [2] to rectify errors introduced by an ASR model. By introducing a model with linguistic intuition, the aim is to provide a supplementary layer of comprehension that can navigate and rectify the nuanced errors arising in ASR transcriptions.\n","\n","**Acknowledgment:**\n","This notebook builds upon the documentation created by Hugging Face, accessible [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart).\n","\n","**Objective:**\n","The code provided in this notebook is a comprehensive overview of the fine-tuning of BART, transforming it into a powerfull post-editing tool.\n","\n","**Input:**\n","- Personal custom dataset\n","- BART pre-trained checkpoint\n","\n","**Output:**\n","The result is overall word error rate of the model.\n","\n","## **References**\n","\n","[1] Samrat Dutta, Shreyansh Jain, Ayush Maheshwari, Souvik Pal, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, and\n","Preethi Jyothi.
